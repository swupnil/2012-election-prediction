2012 U.S. Presidential Election Prediction
====================

As our midterm project for Fall 2012 Stat 157 at UC Berkeley, Jared Park and I created a model to predict the presidential election, implemented in R and requiring the installation of rJAGS. We presented our results in a paper written in Latex. Polling data was the sole input of the model, and was proivded to us by Professor Joseph Richards.
